                <h1>Web Developer</h1>
                <p>As a web developer, I have honed my skills in creating functional and innovative digital solutions.
                     One notable project was a problem-solving system developed for DUT, which achieved an impressive 98% out of 100.
                      This system, designed as a school clinic booking platform, showcased my ability to address real-world problems
                       through effective coding and development practices.</p>


                <p>Currently, I am applying my expertise to develop a customized restaurant management system for a client
                    who recognized my skills and offered me the opportunity.
                     This ongoing project highlights my commitment to delivering high-quality, client-focused solutions.

                <h1>front-end Designer </h1>
                <p>In my role as a front-end designer, 
                    I focus on creating visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces that enhance the overall user experience.
                     My approach combines a strong understanding of design principles with proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                      My recent work includes developing a user-centric school clinic booking system for DUT,
                       which received high praise for its intuitive design and functionality. Additionally, 
                       I am working on a restaurant management system that emphasizes clean design and seamless interaction
                        reflecting my dedication to creating effective and engaging digital experiences.

                <h1>Web Designer</h1>
                <p>As a web designer, I excel in crafting aesthetically pleasing and functional websites 
                    that align with clients' needs and brand identities.
                     My recent projects include a highly-rated school clinic booking system for DUT, 
                     which was recognized for its excellent design and usability.
                      I am also in the process of designing a restaurant website for a client who appreciated my design capabilities.
                       This project is a testament to my ability to blend visual appeal with practical functionality,
                        ensuring that each website I create not only looks great but also serves its intended purpose effectively.

            <p>We go to the same class, and I've always admired his passion.

                <p>As Jaden's dad, I'm proud to share my testimonial about his journey in programming.
                 Although Sboniso initially studied science, he chose to pursue IT at DUT, and I supported his decision wholeheartedly.
                Despite facing challenges due to limited high school exposure, Jaden's dedication and hard work,
                 including studying coding during holidays, have led to impressive progress. His first project was remarkable,
                  showcasing his growth and commitment. I am confident in Jaden's potential and recommend partnering with him on projects,
                   as I believe he will exceed expectations.
